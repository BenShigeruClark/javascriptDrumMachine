Creating a simple drum machine with JavaScript

This app is part of a Wes Bos tutorial, I'v been wanting to play with JavaScript and audio files and this tutorial 
is something that interests me a lot.  Trying to give it a little customization by using a sample pack my friend 
Skyler King created of the Roland TR 909 Drum Synth. Learning how the JavaScript event keycodes work and how to 
assign them to your .wav files.  This is a really great tutorial and I really want to build on the techniques I'm 
learning.
